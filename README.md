Do you have an idea for a new PDA application but not sure where to start?

You have come to the right place.

CASL (Compact Application Solution Language) is an easy to use Windows Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that allows you to build applications for the PalmOSÂ®, PocketPC / Windows Mobile and Windows using a single set of code.
With CASL, you can easily create applications that target multiple operating systems using a high-level programming language that will only take a small investment of your time to learn. Even if you have never created software before, CASL can help make your idea a reality. To create applications in CASL, you take variables, objects, and functions to create powerful and flexible applications.

A short list of available capabilities that can include: 

* Hi-Res (320x320 on the PalmOS) support for Palm and PocketPC.
* Communicate with BlueTooth serial devices using the BlueTooth library (included).
* CASLpro (Palm) Events Library that allows detection of: the Five-Way navigator (DPad), Hard Power Off/On, Soft Power Off/On, Launch Handler (to prevent or allow application exit) and Pen Up/Down/Move.
* Full set of display objects with dynamic control of location, size, font, color, and bitmap properties.
* Full set of event functions, predefined functions, user defined function constructs, conditional branching constructs, and conditional looping constructs. * Indexed db files for fast random access
* Record structures bound to variables for fast read/write of db record
* Grid object with columns, which can be populated with label, textbox, button, checkbox, and dropdown objects bound to DB fields or arrays, for easy display of scrolling data without writing any code.
* Conduit for synchronizing PDA with the desktop computer (Includes Hotsync support for PalmOS and ActiveSync 3.7-4.x support for the PocketPC / Windows Mobile ).
* Network socket access (HTTP, Telnet or TCP)
* PDA file access.
* Much more!
